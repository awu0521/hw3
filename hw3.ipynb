    "1. Calling fit_transform on the test data would cause the scaler to learn the mean and standard deviation from the test set and use those to scale it. This is a problem because the scaler should only be fit on the training data, and the test set should be transformed using the statistics learned from training, not its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Golden Rule states that no information from the test set should leak into the training process. Violating it would actually give you a falsely optimistic classifier, not a worse one, because the model has indirectly seen information about the test data during training. This means your evaluation metrics would overestimate how well the model generalizes to truly unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One advantage of using pipelines is that they prevent data leakage by ensuring that each preprocessing step is fit only on training data and applied consistently to test data. Another advantage is that they make the code cleaner (they make it into one object).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When we have different types of features that each require a different preprocessing transformation. For example, if some features need scaling while others need one-hot encoding or need to be dropped, ColumnTransformer lets us apply each transformation to the appropriate subset of columns at the same time.\n"

Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",
